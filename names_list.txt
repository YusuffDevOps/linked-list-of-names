Filename: names_list.txt
========================================
ProgramDescription

This program takes a single command-line input, which is expected to be a
textfile containing one or more first names, each one three characters long.
The names may be spread over any number of lines and there may be any number
of blank spaces before and/or after each name. The program begins by reading
all the names from the file and putting them into a linked list, in the order
they were read from the file. If the input file cannot be opened, an error
message is displayed, after which the program terminates.

Then the program performs the following actions on this linked list:

1. First, it prints out the names, five per line, each in a fieldwidth of
   six spaces.

2. Second, it ensures that all names have been capitalized and then prints
   them out again, in the same format.

3. Third, it sorts the names in reverse alphabetical order and again prints
   them out in the same format.

4. Fourth, and finally, it moves the first name to the last position and
   prints out the names one last time, in the same format.

                                                                Screen 1 of 1
